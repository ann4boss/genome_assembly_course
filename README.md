# Genome de novo Assembly Course – University of Bern

**Project: De novo Assembly and Quality Assessment of Genomic Reads**

This repository contains the scripts and selected results for the genome de novo assembly analysis carried out as part of the *Genome de novo Assembly* course at the University of Bern. The input FASTQ files for selected accessions were provided via the IBU cluster by the course organizers.

Reads originate from the studies by Lian et al. ([Nature Genetics, 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01715-9)) and Jiao et al. ([Nature Communications, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14779-y)), and were pre-packaged for the course.

The main project goal is to learn the full workflow from **raw reads → genome assembly → quality assessment → reference comparison**, using multiple assemblers and quality control tools. My analysis focused on the accession **Altai-5**.


## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are available:

* Access to the **IBU cluster**.
* A **Bash environment** with SLURM job scheduler.
* **Apptainer** for containerized bioinformatics tools.


## Scripts

### Data preparation and quality control

* **01_download_fastq.sh** – Downloads raw FASTQ files from cluster source.
* **02_quality_control.sh** – Runs FastQC on raw reads.
* **03_run_fastp.sh** – Cleans raw reads using FastP.
* **04_run_MultiQC.sh** – Aggregates QC metrics from FastQC, FastP, assemblies, and quality checks.
* **05_kmer_count.sh** – Performs k-mer counting.

### Assembly workflows

* **06_run_flye.sh** – Assembles reads using Flye.
* **07_run_hifiasm.sh** – Assembles reads using Hifiasm.
* **08_run_LJA.sh** – Assembles reads using LJA.
* **09_run_trinity.sh** – Assembles reads using Trinity (transcriptome).
* **10_copy_assemblies.sh** – Collects assemblies into a single directory for comparison.

### Assembly evaluation

* **11_run_BUSCO.sh** – Runs BUSCO for assembly completeness evaluation.
* **12_plot_BUSCO.sh** – Summarizes and visualizes BUSCO results.
* **13_run_QUAST.sh** – Runs QUAST to assess assembly metrics (e.g., N50, contig counts).
* **14_1_build_meryl.sh** – Builds k-mer database with Meryl.
* **14_2_run_MERQURY.sh** – Runs MERQURY to assess k-mer completeness and QV score.
* **15_compare_ref_to_assemblies.sh** – Compares de novo assemblies to reference genome.
